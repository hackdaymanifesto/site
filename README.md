  <dd>If provided it will turn your name into a link in the supporters section</dd>
</dl>

Commit your changes, push them to github, create a pull request and one of our
helpful contributors will have it merged in.

## Editing

The manifesto content can be found in `content/contents.lr` and the body section
is a markdown document.

You can either edit the file in a text editor or launch the lektor admin and
edit it from there.

## Running locally

The hack day manifesto uses [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com) to render the
web content, and docker-compose to run locally.

To get the development server running in order to see live previews of your
changes or to use the lektor admin run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

The site will now be accessible at http://localhost:5000/
